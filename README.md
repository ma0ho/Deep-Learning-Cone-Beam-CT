# Deep Learning Cone Beam Computed Tomography

This repository provides an implementation of a Cone Beam Backprojection for Tensorflow. It can be used to data-driven learn preprocessing steps in the projection domain. As an example, we include the training of redundancy weights, as reported with the accompanying paper.

## How to build
```
mkdir build
cd build
cmake -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=[...] ..
make && make install
```
